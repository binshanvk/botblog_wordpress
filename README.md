## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Backend

To use this application, you must also run the backend server on your computer:

## ü¶ô Ollama: Recommended for Best Results

While the app can use free online models, we **highly recommend** using Ollama if you have a good PC (modern CPU, 16GB+ RAM recommended). Ollama is truly free, runs locally, is more reliable, and offers better performance and privacy compared to online models.

- **Why use Ollama?**
  - No API limits or hidden costs
  - Works offline, no internet required for generation
  - Faster and more reliable if your hardware supports it
  - Keeps your data private on your machine
